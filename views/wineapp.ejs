              this development I was Team leader working with 2 others, we decided to develop and deploy a Wine buying
              website that would allow account holders to build what we referred to as the caller, this was a list of
              wines that the user could save into a list, for example a Christmas List, or a wedding list. We utilized
              Spoonacularâ€™s API that provided recommended wine and Pricing and Buying links provided, after which we
              added searching functionality to filter by either white or red.
